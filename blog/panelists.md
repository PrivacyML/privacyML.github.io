We are pleased to announce a diverse set of perspectives represented through our panel, covering topics related to privacy evaluations: privacy-preserving machine learning, law and AI privacy, confidential computation, and evaluating AI models.

As you meet the speakers, we welcome questions sent to us. Some potential questions for NeurIPS audience
* What is the state of each of the technologies (Homomorphic encryption for machine learning, secure-mpc or on-device training, private evaluations.) now?
* What do you say to the claim that “privacy is dead”, or “we don’t need privacy”?
* What are the limitations that you think are solvable in the near term?

# Niloofar Mireshghallah
Niloofar Mireshghallah is a post-doctoral scholar at the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering at University of Washington. She received her Ph.D. from the CSE department of UC San Diego in 2023. Her research interests are Trustworthy Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. She is a recipient of the National Center for Women & IT (NCWIT) Collegiate award in 2020 for her work on privacy-preserving inference, a finalist of the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2021 and a recipient of the 2022 Rising star in Adversarial ML award.

# Kim Laine
Kim Laine is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research's Cryptography Group. He is particularly interested in privacy and compliance issues that arise from modern machine learning practices. He works on practical systems for key distributions in E2EE communication, including key transparency systems. He is also working on reputation and accountability systems that can ensure reliable signals in adversarial environments.

With broad interests in applied cryptography, privacy, and security, much of his past work developed and applied homomorphic encryption. For example, he built much of the [Microsoft SEAL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-seal/) homomorphic encryption library and of the [APSI](https://github.com/Microsoft/APSI) private set intersection library, co-organizers of the (HomomorphicEncryption.org)[HomomorphicEncryption.org] standardization initiative. He graduated with an MSc in mathematical physics from University of Helsinki and with a PhD in mathematics from UC Berkeley.

# A. Feder Cooper
Dr. Cooper is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research, an Affiliate Researcher at Stanford HAI, and a future Assistant Professor, Yale CS. Cooper researched topics on reliable measurement and evaluation of machine learning systems and is a co-founder of the [GenLaw Center](https://genlaw.org/).

# Rebecca Qian
Rebecca is the co-founder and CTO of Patronus AI, the industry-first automated LLM evaluation and security platform. The platform enables enterprises to test, score, and benchmark LLM performance on real world scenarios, generate adversarial test cases at scale, monitor hallucinations and other unexpected behavior, and more. Customers include numerous Fortune 500 companies with use cases in diverse domains such as finance, education, and automotive applications.

Prior to Patronus AI, Rebecca was an AI researcher at Meta AI, where she led research in Responsible AI and evaluation. During her time at Meta, she drove research in robustness and safety across NLP domains and use cases, including training the first LLM with demographically debiased data. She has presented her work at venues and conferences including EMNLP, NeurIPS and ACL.
