# Dmitrii Usynin
Dmitrii Usynin is a ML Researcher at Microsoft Research and a final year PhD student in a Joint Academy of Doctoral Studies (JADS) at Imperial College London and TU Munich. His research interests lie on the intersection of collaborative machine learning (CML) and trustworthy artificial intelligence (TAI). In particular, he is  interested in topics such as privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), attacks on CML, adversarial robustness, federated learning and memorisation in ML. Previously Dmitrii has co-organized a workshop and a tutorial on decentralized and privacy-preserving ML at MICCAI. Outside of his PhD, Dmitrii is an Investment Partner at CreatorFund, leading early-stage deep tech investment in Europe. Previously he was also a privacy researcher at OpenMined, working on federated learning and differential privacy in healthcare.
